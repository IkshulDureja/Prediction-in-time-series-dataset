## Task
We are predicting the parameters Para-9, Para-10, Para-11, Para-12, and Para-13 for year 10 from a 10-year dataset from an IoT sensor on the road.

## Model Used
We have used Extreme Gradient Boosting Machine for solving this problem.

## Results
The RMSE value of the model is 25.610470773009403.
